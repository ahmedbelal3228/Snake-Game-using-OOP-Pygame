WINDOW PART : 
    1 -Importing PYGAME 
    2- Initialize pygame 
    3- Setting the window height and width
    4- Setting the window title 
    5- Creating a loop to open the window unitll quit
    6- Choosing the colors of the element and set it as variables
    

DISPLAYING AND MOVING THE SNAKE  : 
    1- Making a list consist of 3 bolcks (the snake's head , body and tail)
    2- Give the snake initail position when the game starts 
    3- Conroling the movement of the snake when press the keys 
    4- Making the snake move by adding new_head with the new coordinates and remove the tail .

THE FOOD : 
    1- Creating the food block (the same size as the snake block)
    2- Initial position of the food
        - Appears in random postion but with condition : 
            1- Be within the screen boundaries
            2- Not overlap with the snake's current position.
            3- Disappear when the snake touch it 
            4- Appears again in random position with the same conditions
COLLISION DETECTION:
    1- The snake eats the foof -> the snake grow
    2- The snake hits any border of the screen -> game over

DISPALY 
    1- Display the score on the screen 
    2- Display game over when lose
